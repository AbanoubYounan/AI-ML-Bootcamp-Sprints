Fine-Tuning BERT for Question Answering
This project focuses on fine-tuning a BERT-based model for question answering tasks, leveraging the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and the Hugging Face Transformers library. The solution includes a fine-tuned model and a user-friendly Streamlit web application for interactive question answering.

Features
[cite_start]

BERT Model Fine-tuning: Fine-tuned google-bert/bert-base-uncased model on the SQuAD dataset.   

[cite_start]

Data Preprocessing: Implemented custom functions to tokenize questions and contexts, align tokenized data with answer spans, and handle overflowing tokens.   

[cite_start]

Interactive Web Application: Developed a Streamlit application for real-time question answering using the fine-tuned model.   

[cite_start]

Performance Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using Exact Match (EM) and F1 Score metrics.   

Methodology and Steps Taken
The fine-tuning process involved the following key steps:

[cite_start]

Importing Libraries: Utilized evaluate, datasets, and transformers libraries.   

[cite_start]

Loading Data: Loaded the SQuAD dataset (rajpurkar/squad), which includes 87,599 training samples and 10,570 validation samples.   

[cite_start]

Data Preprocessing: Tokenized questions and contexts using the BERT tokenizer, aligned tokenized data with answer spans, and stored start/end positions of answers.   

[cite_start]

Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuned the bert-base-uncased model using the Trainer API from the transformers library, defining essential parameters like learning rate, batch size, and epochs.   

[cite_start]

Saving the Model: The trained model was saved for later inference.   

Experimentation Details
Hyperparameters:

[cite_start]Learning Rate: 3e-5    

[cite_start]Batch Size: 16    

[cite_start]Epochs: 2    

[cite_start]Weight Decay: 0.01    

Challenges Encountered:

[cite_start]

Memory Consumption: Fine-tuning large transformer models required high GPU memory, leading to consideration of optimization techniques like gradient accumulation.   

[cite_start]

Slow Training Speed: Fine-tuning was time-consuming due to the large dataset and model size; batch size adjustments helped manage computational efficiency.   

Evaluation Results
The model was evaluated on the validation set, achieving:

[cite_start]

Exact Match (EM): 80.3%    

[cite_start]

F1 Score: 89.7%    

[cite_start]These results indicate strong performance in answer extraction accuracy.   

Technologies Used
Python

Hugging Face Transformers

PyTorch

Streamlit

Datasets (Hugging Face)

Evaluate (Hugging Face)

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Jupyter Notebook

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository (if applicable):

Bash

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install transformers datasets evaluate streamlit torch
(Note: Additional dependencies might be required based on the environment setup in the Jupyter notebook.)

Download the SQuAD dataset and pre-trained BERT model:
[cite_start]The dataset and model are automatically downloaded by the scripts using 

load_dataset("rajpurkar/squad") and AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-uncased"), AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-uncased").   

Usage
1. Fine-tuning the BERT Model:
Run the finetune-bert-for-question-answering.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data, fine-tune the BERT model, and save the trained model.

2. Running the Streamlit Application:
[cite_start]After the model is saved to 

./saved_model (as referenced in app.py ), you can run the Streamlit application:   


bash streamlit run app.py 
[cite_start]This will open a web interface where you can input a context and a question to get an answer from the fine-tuned BERT model.
