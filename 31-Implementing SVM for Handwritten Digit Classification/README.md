# Task Description:
## Task: Implementing SVM for Handwritten Digit Classification
### Objective:
Develop a machine learning model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify handwritten digits from a dataset.

### Requirement 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploration
#### Requirements:

- Load the digit dataset using Python.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize samples of the digits and examine class distributions.
- Scale the features (e.g., pixel intensities) using normalization or standardization.

#### Deliverables:

#### Required Deliverable 1:
- A Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code for loading the dataset, performing EDA, and feature scaling.

### Requirement 2: SVM Model Development and Training

#### Requirements:

- Implement an SVM model using the scikit-learn library.
- Train the model on the training dataset, tuning the kernel (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF) to optimize performance.
- Evaluate the model using appropriate classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### Deliverables:

#### Required Deliverable 2:
- Python code implementing the SVM classifier.
- Classification report showing the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Requirement 3: Result Analysis and Documentation

#### Requirements:

- Analyze the classification results and identify cases of misclassification.
- Provide insights on the model's performance across different classes.
- Document the entire process, including code, observations, and results.

#### Deliverables:

#### Required Deliverable 3:
- A final report (PDF or Word document) describing the entire workflow, insights from misclassification cases, and conclusions about the model's performance.

#### Dataset: from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
