# Task Description:
## Task: Implementing and Evaluating Logistic Regression
### Objective:
This task will help you practice implementing logistic regression and evaluating classification models using scikit-learn. You will train a logistic regression model, evaluate its performance, and compare it to other classification algorithms.

### Requirement 1: Dataset Loading and Preprocessing
#### Requirements:

- Use a simple dataset, such as the Iris dataset available in scikit-learn.
- Preprocess the data by handling any missing values (if applicable) and standardizing features for better model performance.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training and 20% testing).

#### Deliverables:

#### Required Deliverable 1:
- A Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing code for loading and preprocessing the dataset.

### Requirement 2: Model Implementation and Training
#### Requirements:
- Implement a logistic regression model using scikit-learn and train it on the dataset.
- Train at least two other classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree and KNN) on the same dataset.

#### Deliverables:

#### Required Deliverable 2:
- A Jupyter Notebook or Python script implementing logistic regression and at least two other classifiers (Decision Tree, KNN, etc.).
- Include hyperparameter settings for each model (e.g., maximum depth for Decision Tree, the value of k for KNN).

### Requirement 3: Model Evaluation and Comparison
#### Requirements:
- Evaluate all models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- Compare the results of logistic regression with those of the other models.
- Visualize the performance using confusion matrices.

#### Deliverables:

#### Required Deliverable 3:
- A Jupyter Notebook or Python script with evaluation metrics and visualizations (confusion matrix).
- A summary table (Excel or PDF) comparing performance metrics for all models.
- A final report (PDF or Word document) with insights on which model performed best and why.
