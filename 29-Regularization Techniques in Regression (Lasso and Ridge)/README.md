# Task Description:

# Task: Regularization Techniques in Regression (Lasso and Ridge)
### Objective:
This task will help you practice applying regularization techniques to regression models using scikit-learn. You will implement Lasso and Ridge regression models and compare their performance to standard linear regression.

### Requirement 1: Implement Regularization Techniques
#### Requirements:

- Develop a Python program using a real-world dataset (e.g., Boston House Prices or a similar dataset) to predict house prices.
- Apply Lasso Regularization to perform feature selection and show which features are removed or retained.
- Apply Ridge Regularization to ensure all features are preserved with reduced coefficients.
Deliverables:

#### Required Deliverable 1:
A Python file or Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the task. Include detailed comments in the code for clarity.


### Requirement 2: Evaluate and Compare
#### Requirements:

- Train and evaluate the models with both regularization techniques.
- Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to compare their performance on training and testing datasets.
- Visualize the coefficients for both techniques to highlight their impact on feature importance.
Deliverables:

#### Required Deliverable 2:
A set of plots or graphs (saved as images or included in the notebook) showing:
The coefficients of features before and after applying regularization.
Performance comparison (e.g., bar chart comparing MSE and R-squared values).

### Requirement 3: Explain the Results
#### Requirements:

- Write a short report explaining:
- How each technique improved the model's performance.
- The impact of the regularization term (alpha) on the results.
- A recommendation on which technique suits this use case and why.

#### Required Deliverable 3: A PDF report (2-3 pages) summarizing:
- The methodology and findings.
- The comparison between Lasso and Ridge.
- The reasoning behind your recommendation.
- Screenshots of key results for clarity.
